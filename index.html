We only act as a bridge between the User and the Service Provider, the User is not a customer of Servisit when it comes to the services offered by the Service Provider. The User is only the customer of Servisit during the finding and booking process of the service, the user is now the customer of the Service Provider afterward. You are given the opportunity to rate and review the Service Provider, for this will have an impact on the Service Provider's future customers.</p>
        <p>In cases wherein the service of the Service Provider is non-satisfactory, or have damaged your property, Servisit will act as a remediator of the User and the Service Provider and a re-service can be done as long as it is within its warranty period (warranty depends on the type of service). If the Service Provider does not uphold their responsibility of fixing the said service, the only remedy possible is a refund of what the User has paid (this is the reason why we highly encourage you to pay through us) and the Service Provider will be removed from Servisit’s list of partners. In addition, if you directly contact the Service Provider we cannot help you remediate the services.</p>

        <h6 class = "bold-h">Disclaimer</h6>
        <p>Servisit is merely an online platform that connects its Users to Servisitors, and is not a Service Provider itself. We provide you with the portfolio of the Service provider so that you can properly gauge their capabilities. Given that, Servisit and its team is not responsible or liable for the performance of the service/s done by the Servisitor/s as well as the injuries, accidents, or any activity that happened between the Servisitor and their customer. We only act as a bridge between the User and the Servisitor, the User is not a customer of Servisit when it comes to the services offered by the Servisitor. The User is only the customer of Servisit during the finding and booking process, the user is now the customer of the Servisitor afterwards. You are given the opportunity to rate and review the Service Provider, for this will have an impact on the Service Provider's future customers. </p>
        <p>In cases wherein the service of the Servisitor is non-satisfactory, or have damaged your property, Servisit will act as a remediator of the User and the Servisitor and a re-service can be done as long as it is within its warranty period (warranty depends on the type of service). If the Servisitor does not uphold their responsibility of fixing the said service, the only remedy possible is a refund of what the User has paid (this is the reason why we highly encourage you to pay through us) and the Servisitor will be removed from Servisit’s list of partners.</p>
        <p>Lastly, Servisit only provides you with services and Servisitors to choose from and the entire cost only relates to labour and application fees, and does not invclude the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>materials to be used in the project,</li>
          <li>tools to aid the service provider, and</li>
          <li>other incidental expenses (i.e. transportation costs to buy and rent the said tools and materials, etc.).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The items stated above are now the concern of the Userand the Servisitor.</p>
        
        <h6 class = "bold-h">Governing Law</h6>
        <p>These Terms and Conditions and your use of the Platform are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of the Philippine applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed within the Philippines, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>
        
        <h6 class = "bold-h">Termination</h6>
        <p>We may terminate or request you to re-do or edit your booking if we deem it necessary due to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>you’re representing another person or entity without their consent</li>
